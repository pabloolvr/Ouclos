Web Project for SCC0219

## Requirements
 - The system have 2 types of users: Customers and Administrators. The application already comes with an admin account with password admin.

 - Administrators are responsible for registering/managing by turning an non administrator user into an administrator.

 - Administrators responsible for manage products, e.g., they can create, update, read and delete products.

 - Administrators are also responsible to manage orders, they can read, set as delivered and delete orders.

 - Customers are non administrator users that access the system to buy products.

 - The admin's and customer's records include: name, surname, cpf, birthdate, phone, email and address.

 - Product's records include: id, name, photo, quantity in stock, category, gender, style, lens material, frame material, lens color, frame color, lens protection and description.

## Source comments
The source code of the project is consisted of two parts, frontend and backend.
### Frontend

The frontend part contains all files related to the visual part of the system. It has a global ```index.css``` file, responsible for all the website styling and a ```store.css``` file, which is the redux store, responsible to hold the current application state inside of it. Inside the frontend part there are two directories, ```public```, which basically stores images used in the application and ```src```, which stores all the source code of the application, divided into the following directories:
 - ```src/actions```: stores methods responsible to execute events in the application, like making requests to the server, from different entities of the system.
 - ```src/components```: stores source code of reusable components used in the site, like the product card.
 - ```src/pages```: stores the pages of the website.
 - ```src/reducers```: stores functions that change the states of the application based on actions performed, each reducer is directly used in the redux store.
 - ```src/constants```: defines what type of actions can be performed for each reducer.
 
### Backend

The backend part contains all files related to the data management part of the system. It have ```index.js```, responsible to run the server, ```utils.js```, responsible to implement authentication methods and ```data.js```, which stores predefined data to send to the database. The backend part has two directories:
 - ```models```: stores the data models of entities of the database, e.g., the data fields of entities like product and user.
 - ```routers```: stores server routes to different http requests of entities of the system.
