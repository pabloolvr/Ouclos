## Source comments
The source code of the project is consisted of two parts, frontend and backend.
### Frontend

The frontend part contains all files related to the visual part of the system. It has a global ```index.css``` file, responsible for all the website styling and a ```store.css``` file, which is the redux store, responsible to hold the current application state inside of it. Inside the frontend part there are two directories, ```public```, which basically stores images used in the application and ```src```, which stores all the source code of the application, divided into the following directories:
 - actions
 - components
 - constants
 - pages
 - reducers
